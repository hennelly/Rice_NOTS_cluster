# Notes on NOTS 

/home /projects /rhf /scratch

Storage to store behind jobs. Copy data from /storage/hpc/work, run job, and save your work back. 
/storage/hpc/work
/storage/conda/*

/project -> shared among the research group
/rhf -> pay to use
/home -> may home
/scratch -> high reading and writing input output the jobs. 

Sponser Fee: $50 per month
User fee: $10 per month

CRC Office Hours - in-person office hours every Tuesday from 10am-2pm in Mudd 101A/ 

Partition Names
commons - general shared computing pool. 24 hour wall time
long - 3 day wall time for jobs that need to run longer - new scheduling option
debug - short jobs, debugging, interaction with the command is needed
scavenge - take advantage of idle condo resources. 1 hour wall time. 

Managing data on NOTS
- they purge scratch, inactive for more than two weeks, they will be deleted. 
- Move data off of scratch to other systems. 
- Home directory /home. Quota of 10Gb per user. 
- Group Project directory: 100GB per group /projects (place python, shared software, shared python environments, conda bioconda, )
- Work storage space: /storage/hpc/work -> 2 TB per group
- RHF - /rhf/allocations/ - quota varies 
- shared fast scratch - /scratch - size is 300 TB, no quota. Purges in 14 days
- local scratch per node - /tmp -> 4 TB, no quota, purged at the end of each job. 


rhf -> store large active datasets, compute nodes can also get to the compute nodes. /work/ nodes can not be accessed by the compute node. 
They suggest to pull out data from /work/ and put into scratch. 

External compute servers, can export same rfh allocation to work group servers. Saves a step to copy the datasets into NOTS. 

NOTS uses LMOD to manage software environmental variables. Many packages and software like R. 

If want to run matlab on the cluster, we can search for module spider command. 

module spider matlab -> gives all information on matlab and versions and the location 

 module spider matlab/2023a -> tell you more an dtell you how to load it in the enviornment. 

Can do module load MATLAB/2023b
which matlab
/opt/apps/software/MATLAB/2023b/bin/matlab
This will tell you where the version is found. 

use module spider python/3.11.5 will tell you which other modules you will need to load. 

module list -> what modules are currently loaded at the time. 
module purge -> exits out of all modules
